Portal extension
-------------------------------

Installation instructions:

This is an alpha version! The extension works best on Firefox.

- The alpha version of the extension requires you have Flash installed on your browser.
  This will hopefully change in the future. The Flash component is used to load files.

- Unpack the archive and place the 'portal' folder in the 'extension' folder.

- Open the file /settings/override/site.ini.append(.php) and add the portal
  extension to the list of active extensions:

	[ExtensionSettings]
	ActiveExtensions[]=portal

- Open the file /settings/siteaccess/[admin_siteaccess]/toolbar.ini.append.php 
  and modify [Toolbar_admin_right] as follows: 
  
  [Toolbar_admin_right]
  Tool[]
  Tool[]=admin_portal
  Tool[]=admin_current_user
  Tool[]=admin_bookmarks
  
- Your admin home page will now have a button at the top of /content/view/full/2: 'Switch to portal view'.
  With this button you may switch between the 'normal' and 'portal' view.
  
Known issues:
- YUI 3.0 Portal has some issues with Internet Explorer when reloading the page;
- Flash component needs to be replaced with Javascript in the future;
- Javascript within the widgets is not supported;
- The definition of the widgets should probably be moved from portal.tpl to a settings file;
- Not sure which parts of the YUI 3.0 are really required;
- RSS icon needs to be replaced with something more meaningful;
- Policy checks have not been implemented yet around the available widgets;
- Preferences are stored in a cookie, and not as ezpreference.
